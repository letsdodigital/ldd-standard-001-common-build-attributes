# ldd-standard-001-common-build-attributes

A standard that all modern digital healthcare apps should stand to.

Currently building this standard, but here are some initial thoughts:

1. Web first.
2. Python based as much as possible (so people on have to learn one language, at least initially).
3. Authentication and authorisation.
4. Configurable pathways (for the disease / company wanting the app).
5. DevSecRegOps are the core.
6. Full unit testing and integration testing.
7. Interoperability with other systems - perhaps we will use openEHR (or FHIR).
8. Documentation in code (docstrings).
9. Typing (mypy).
10. Cybersecurity (black)
11. Open source all the way baby.
