So I have been thinking about the “base” healthcare app today. I really like the idea. It is actually a cool name for the final app - Base! I also like the idea of modular parts that you add for functionality. What has been bugging me for some time is if you are going to build an amazing, safe, functional and maintainable system it is difficult to make it simple in terms of code, and hence easy for those with less coding experiences. So I like the idea of “hiding” the complicated code and structures in the “base” app and then other people can add modules for the functionality you want. These modules would have “simpler code” in them, so easier for others to build new modules. And for pre-existing modules, these will be easy even for the non-coder to use and setup. A first stab at the kind of modules you would want (and putting them all together gives you most likely an EPR) would include:

1. ePROMS (electronic patient reported outcome measures)
2. Clinician / admin facing CDSS (clinician decision support systems)
3. Patient facing CDSS
4. Medical note taking
5. PAS (patient administration system) for clinic and bed management.
6. LIMS - for labs
7. PACS for imaging
8. Requests and referrals
9. ePMA for prescribing
10. Messaging system (clinician-admin-patient)
11. Scheduling
12. Exports
13. Image capture, uploads, downloads and storage
14. Community forum
15. Patient information leaflets, pages, videos and other resources
